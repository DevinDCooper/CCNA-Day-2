This journal is my personal record of progress as I work toward earning my CCNA. I’ll document every lab I complete, the concepts I learn, and the challenges I overcome. My goal is to build a clear picture of how my skills develop over time. As I grow, I’m excited to look back on these entries and see how far I’ve come.

CCNA Journey – Day 2
**Lab Title: Connecting Devices **
Date: 11-22-25

📌 Overview
The main purpose of this lab was to connect all devices together using the respected transfer and receive ports available. Also keep in mind the distance and using the right cabling for that distance. 

🧠 What I Learned
- I learned about straight-through cables, crossover cables, single-mode fiber cables, and multi-mode fiber cables. 
- How router switches, servers, and PCs have different transmit and receive ports. 
- How old are devices required to use a certain cable in order for them to connect vs newer devices being able to use MDX and any wires to connect?
  
🛠 Lab Details

Connect the network devices together according to the labels.

Use the appropriate type of cable .

For practice, assume that Auto MDI-X is disabled, or not supported on the devices.

NOTE: Packet Tracer doesn't differentiate between single-mode 
and multimode fiber, but think about which one is appropriate when you 
use a fiber connection.
